## It seemed like a good idea at the time

I think I've decided to use Ansible for deploying the blog.  I know, you're probably saying "But Jonathan, isn't that overkill for a simple site?" to which I would say "You're not wrong."  My reasoning is that I'd like to use Ansible and Vagrant to learn how to use Hadoop sometime in the near future.  Even if I don't get to Hadoop anytime soon, Ansible is still super powerful.  I also already have a little exposure to Salt for deployment and I'd like to expand my toolbox and/or comfort zone.

I began using the [introduction](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_getting_started.html) in Ansible's documentation pages.  Their intro is very thorough, but for my purposes, I'm glad I found [Ansible Up & Running](http://www.ansiblebook.com/) by Hochstein and Moser.  While Ansible does a good job of introducing all the features, Up and Running provides a better tutorial.  In the first couple chapters you have been introduced to some of the basics, but you've done so by getting your hands dirty and building something that resembles a use-case.  It may well be that Lorin Hochstein's stint as an educator is shining through.

For my current needs, following just the first two chapters and then glancing at the chapters on inventories and variables seems to be sufficient.  As a bonus, the official Ansible documentation makes more sense and is easier to digest now.
