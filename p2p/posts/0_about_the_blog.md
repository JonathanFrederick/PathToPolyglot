## Concerning Blogging

![I've Put This Off For Far Too Long](http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/9c/9c6ddda4063b223e916c044a1e36e978bd848136963393c021ba5ddaa8c52189.jpg)

This post is largely concerned with blogging, and from its paragraphs, a reader may discover much of my purpose and a little
of my history.  

If you haven't gleaned such from elsewhere, I attended a now-defunct bootcamp and have been struggling to turn those experiences into a developer job.  While it wasn't required of my Python class, I learned late in the bootcamp that the more successful Front-End class had to blog about their experiences as we went along.  While blogging can't possibly be the only difference that resulted in the Front-end class producing more full-time developers, it should have several benefits:
  - Others can see how I think, how I process ideas
  - __I__ can see how I think and process ideas
  - I get experience discussing code and computer science in English
    - (probably useful for interviews)
  - My growth as a developer gains a little more structure

I'm sure there are other benefits, perhaps later I'll dedicate a larger post to the benefits of blogging.

## This Blog in Particular

Here I'll chronicle my growth as a developer and as a member of the tech community/industry.  The format will likely change over time, and that's okay.  The blog should primarily focus on my learning new things.  Once I'm more established, I may write more generally about learning, teaching, or goings-on in the tech industry.  The format may get shorter or longer, more professional or more colloquial.  Future posts may or may not contain extended Lord of the Rings references.  Mostly, this blog will be an educational adventure and I'm excited to see where it goes.

### Path to Polyglot

I've been sitting on this URL for more than a year now with the intent of using it for a blog.  It came from my dream of some day being able to do everything under the sun that has to do with technology and my fascination for alliteration.

As I hope to imply with the use of the word 'polyglot', I would like to have a working knowledge of most common programming languages.  Of course, in the realm of computer programming, it is not just a matter of what language you use.  While I have several uses of programming I am curious about, I hope the exploration of these technologies will help me discover my professional niche.
